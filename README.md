# procurement-risk-model

## üìñ Project Overview

The **Procurement Risk Model** is both a research tool and a documented framework for identifying high-risk contracts in public procurement data. The goal of this project is to build something with tangible impact ‚Äî a system that helps make the world more just and fair by holding businesses and governments accountable to transparent and competitive procurement practices. Fair competition benefits everyone, and this project is designed to highlight when the rules aren‚Äôt being followed.

At its core, the repository provides a reproducible workflow for analyzing procurement data to flag potential red flags such as non-competitive tenders, suspicious spending concentration, or unusually short bidding windows. While the current implementation is focused on **Mexico‚Äôs procurement data**, the model is designed to be extensible. The raw data source ([Government Transparency Institute](https://www.govtransparency.eu/)) provides CSV exports for over **40 countries**, meaning users can easily plug in other datasets and generate comparable risk analyses.

This project is intended to serve two audiences:
- **Technical users** who want to extend the codebase, adapt it for other countries, or build more advanced models (e.g., with machine learning and AI tools).  
- **Non-technical users** such as attorneys, investigators, and policymakers who need clear, data-driven indicators to identify high-risk entities and contracts as starting points for deeper investigations.

Ultimately, this repository documents what can be built with Python while also serving as a foundation for further projects in proactive risk monitoring and fraud detection.

## ‚ú® Features & Capabilities

The Procurement Risk Model provides a set of tools for analyzing public procurement data and flagging potential indicators of fraud or corruption risk. Current features include:

- **Aggregate Bidder Risk Scoring**  
  Generates a composite score for each bidder based on multiple red-flag indicators, making it easy to identify the riskiest entities.

- **Red-Flag Modules**  
  The model evaluates several common risk signals in procurement data:
  - **Non-competitive tenders** ‚Äì flags contracts awarded without open competition.  
  - **Spending concentration** ‚Äì highlights when a single supplier consistently wins a large share of awards from a single buyer.  
  - **Short bid windows** ‚Äì identifies contracts where the time to submit bids was unusually short.  
  - **Contract splitting** ‚Äì detects when larger procurements may have been divided into smaller lots to bypass thresholds or oversight.  

- **Country-Specific Flexibility**  
  Currently configured for **Mexico‚Äôs procurement data**, but the system can be easily adapted to any of the 40+ countries with open CSV data from the Government Transparency Institute.

- **Extensible Framework**  
  Designed as a foundation for further development, including integration with **machine learning** or **AI tools** for advanced risk modeling.

- **Documentation & Transparency**  
  Clear output tables and summaries make the results accessible for both technical users (who can extend the code) and non-technical users (who can use the outputs to guide investigations).


## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

This project is designed to support both **non-technical** and **technical** audiences. Choose the path that fits your role and needs:

### üßë‚Äçüíº For Non-Technical Users

- You can start exploring the results immediately by downloading the **`MX_procurement_risk_report.xlsx`** file from the `output/` folder in this repository.  
  This file contains a risk report already generated for **Mexico‚Äôs procurement data**.  
- The meaning of each red flag indicator will be covered in depth later in this README.  
- If you‚Äôd like to see results for a **different country**, you have two options:  
  1. **Contact me directly** and I can run the model for you.  
  2. Work with a **data scientist or technical colleague** who can run the model internally using the instructions below.


### üë©‚Äçüíª For Technical Users

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ryan-berkowitz98/procurement-risk-model.git
   cd procurement-risk-model

2. **Set up a Python environment**  
   - Python 3.9+ is recommended.  
   - Install dependencies:  
  
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Prepare the input data**
    - **Choose a country.** See the list of supported countries in the [data brief (p.4)](https://www.govtransparency.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Fazekas-et-al_Global-PP-data_published_2024.pdf).
    - **Download the country-level CSV.** Use the [Global Contract-Level Public Procurement Dataset](https://www.govtransparency.eu/global-contract-level-public-procurement-dataset/) (maintained by the **Government Transparency Institute**) or go directly to the [dataset download index](https://input.mendeley.com/inputsets/fwzpywbhgw/3).
    - **Place the file in `input/`.** Name it using the convention:
    
       `{country_code}_DIB_[YYYY].csv`  
       Example: `MX_DIB_2023.csv`

4. **Run the pipeline**
  - Each script in the `src/` directory is modular and can be executed from the command line or within a Python environment.
  - A typical run might look like:
    ```bash
    python src/01_input.py
    python src/02_clean_transform.py
    python src/03_flag_non_competitive.py
    ...
    python src/99_export_risk_report.py
  - Final outputs (including Excel summaries and more detailed flagged risk parquet files) will be written to the '/output' directory.
  

## üìä Outputs

Running the pipeline generates a Excel risk report in the `output/` directory. Most users will start with the Excel report:

### How to read the results (quick guide)

- **Risk score = heat level.** A higher score simply means ‚Äúlook here first.‚Äù It‚Äôs a triage signal, not a final judgment.
- **Flags = clues, not proof.** Each flag points to a pattern (e.g., no competition, short bid window). Use them to form a hypothesis, then verify in the source docs.
- **Quick workflow:**
  1. Open **Bidder Risk Summary** and sort by `risk_score` (highest first).
  2. Filter for `Number of Risk Flags ‚â• 2` to find stronger signals.
  3. Cross-check the same bidders/buyers across other tabs (Non-Comp, Concentration, Short Windows, Splitting). Names that repeat move up the priority list.
  4. Focus first on records with **larger spend** or **more awards** (higher potential impact).
- **Then dive deeper:** Investigate the entities behind each name‚Äîowners, shareholders, and parent/affiliate links. Repeat offenders often re-incorporate under new names. Look for continuity signals like:
  - Shared directors/officers or overlapping shareholders
  - Common addresses, phone numbers, or email domains
  - Reused tax IDs/registration numbers (where available)
  - Identical websites or branding across ‚Äúnew‚Äù companies
 

## üß≠ Red-Flag Definitions & Methodology

This project computes several directional indicators (‚Äúflags‚Äù). Flags are **clues, not proof**‚Äîuse them to prioritize human review.

### How scoring works (high level)

- Each module emits a flag and a **module risk score** that is a **percentile rank scaled 0‚Äì100** (100 = highest risk relative to peers in the dataset).
- The **aggregate bidder risk score** is the **evenly weighted average across all modules** (e.g., Non-Competitive, Spending Concentration, Short Bid Windows, Contract Splitting).  
  **If a module is missing for a bidder, that module‚Äôs score is treated as 0.**
  - Example: `aggregate = (NC + CONC + SHORT + SPLIT) / 4`
- Higher scores = higher review priority. 

### üî¥ Non-Competitive Tenders

**What it flags:** contracts awarded with little or no real competition (e.g., direct awards or single-bidder tenders). Repeated success in these deals can be a warning sign.

**Why it matters:** when open competition is skipped, the risk of favoritism, waste, or corruption goes up. This module helps spot suppliers who rely heavily on such awards.

**What the module does:**
1. Looks at every supplier‚Äôs awards, then picks out the ones marked *non-competitive* (flagged earlier in the cleaning module).
2. Totals **how many** non-competitive awards a supplier won and **how much money** those awards are worth.
3. Finds the supplier‚Äôs **top government buyer** for these non-competitive awards (who pays them the most in this category).
4. Calculates **shares**, like:  
   - What **percent of the supplier‚Äôs wins** were non-competitive?  
   - What **percent of their total payments** came from non-competitive awards?
5. Ignores trivial cases using **minimum thresholds** (set in `config.py`) so tiny, one-off awards don‚Äôt create noise.
6. Ranks suppliers with a simple **risk score** that goes up when they both (a) win **many** non-competitive awards and (b) are **highly dependent** on them.

**How to use it:**
- Start with suppliers at the **top of the list** (higher score = look here first).
- Prioritize names that show **both** a high number of non-competitive wins **and** a high **percentage** of their business coming from them.
- Note repeated pairings with the **same buyer**‚Äîthat can indicate a relationship worth reviewing.

**Outputs you get:**
- **Summary file** ‚Äî one row per supplier with counts, dollars, shares, top buyer, and a **risk score**  
  *(used by the overall risk scoring to prioritize review).*
- **Detail file** ‚Äî every **non-competitive contract** for drill-down (who bought what, when, and for how much).

> **Tuning:** You can raise or lower the minimum dollar amounts and one-tender floor in `config.py` to match your risk tolerance (e.g., ignore very small awards or require at least one sizable non-competitive contract).
