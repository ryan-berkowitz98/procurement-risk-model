# procurement-risk-model

## ðŸ“– Project Overview

The **Procurement Risk Model** is both a research tool and a documented framework for identifying high-risk contracts in public procurement data. The goal of this project is to build something with tangible impact â€” a system that helps make the world more just and fair by holding businesses and governments accountable to transparent and competitive procurement practices. Fair competition benefits everyone, and this project is designed to highlight when the rules arenâ€™t being followed.

At its core, the repository provides a reproducible workflow for analyzing procurement data to flag potential red flags such as non-competitive tenders, suspicious spending concentration, or unusually short bidding windows. While the current implementation is focused on **Mexicoâ€™s procurement data**, the model is designed to be extensible. The raw data source (Government Transparency Institute) provides CSV exports for over **40 countries**, meaning users can easily plug in other datasets and generate comparable risk analyses.

This project is intended to serve two audiences:
- **Technical users** who want to extend the codebase, adapt it for other countries, or build more advanced models (e.g., with machine learning and AI tools).  
- **Non-technical users** such as attorneys, investigators, and policymakers who need clear, data-driven indicators to identify high-risk entities and contracts as starting points for deeper investigations.

Ultimately, this repository documents what can be built with Python while also serving as a foundation for further projects in proactive risk monitoring and fraud detection.
